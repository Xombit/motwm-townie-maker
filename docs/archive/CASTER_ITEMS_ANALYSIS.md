# Wands, Rods, and Staffs for Casters
## Understanding the Three Item Classes

This document analyzes wands, rods, and staffs to determine how to best equip casters instead of giving them +1-+5 weapons they'll rarely use.

---

## How Each Item Type Works

### Wands - Cheap Spell Storage (375 - 21,000 gp)

**What They Do:**
- Store a **single spell** of 4th level or lower
- Come with **50 charges** when created
- Each use expends **1 charge**
- Standard action to activate (spell trigger, no AoO)
- Anyone can use them (no class requirement)
- Uses **minimum caster level** for the spell
- Save DC based on **minimum ability score** to cast (e.g., DC 11 for 1st level spell)

**Pricing Formula:**
```
Spell level × Caster level × 750 gp
```

**Examples:**
- Cure Light Wounds (CL 1): 750 gp (50 charges = 15 gp per casting)
- Magic Missile at CL 5 (3 missiles): 3,750 gp (75 gp per casting)
- Fireball at CL 5: 11,250 gp (225 gp per casting)
- Cure Critical Wounds (CL 7): 21,000 gp (420 gp per casting)

**Best For:**
- Cheap backup healing (Wand of CLW is 750 gp for 50 charges!)
- Utility spells you need frequently (Detect Magic, Light, Invisibility)
- Low-level combat spells for emergencies
- **Not great for save-or-die spells** (DC is too low with minimum caster level)

**Weaknesses:**
- **Low save DCs** (minimum caster level and ability score)
- Limited to 4th level spells
- Once charges are gone, it's useless (can't recharge)
- Takes up a hand/requires drawing

---

### Rods - Power Modifiers & Utility (3,000 - 170,000 gp)

**What They Do:**
- Provide **ongoing abilities** or **metamagic modifications**
- **No charges** (most rods) - unlimited use per day (with limits)
- Can be used while casting your own spells
- Some function as weapons (+2 or +3 light maces)

**Two Categories:**

#### A) Metamagic Rods (3,000 - 170,000 gp)
Allow you to apply metamagic feats **without increasing spell slot**:
- **Lesser**: Works on spells up to 3rd level
- **Normal**: Works on spells up to 6th level  
- **Greater**: Works on spells up to 9th level
- Each rod can be used **3 times per day**

**Metamagic Rod Costs:**
```
Enlarge (double range):          3,000 / 11,000 / 24,500 gp
Extend (double duration):         3,000 / 11,000 / 24,500 gp
Silent (no verbal components):    3,000 / 11,000 / 24,500 gp
Empower (+50% damage/healing):    9,000 / 32,500 / 73,000 gp
Maximize (max damage/healing):   14,000 / 54,000 / 121,500 gp
Quicken (swift action cast):     35,000 / 75,500 / 170,000 gp
```

**Key Advantage:** A 9th-level wizard with Rod of Quicken (Lesser) can cast a 3rd-level spell as a swift action **without using a 7th-level spell slot** (normally Quicken Spell increases slot by +4 levels).

#### B) Utility Rods (5,000 - 85,000 gp)
Special-purpose rods with unique abilities:
- **Immovable Rod** (5,000 gp): Stops in place, supports 8,000 lbs (dungeon utility)
- **Rod of Absorption** (50,000 gp): Absorbs spells targeted at you, stores 50 spell levels, use stored energy to cast your own spells
- **Rod of Negation** (37,000 gp): Dispel magic vs items, 3/day
- **Rod of Alertness** (85,000 gp): +1 initiative, detect alignment, planted gives 120 ft warning + prayer effect
- **Rod of Splendor** (25,000 gp): +4 Charisma while held (competes with Cloak of Charisma!)

**Best For:**
- **Metamagic rods are AMAZING** for high-level casters (cast more efficiently)
- Quicken rods let you cast 2 spells per round (swift + standard)
- Empower/Maximize rods increase damage without spell slot cost
- Absorption rod is defensive gold for wizards

**Weaknesses:**
- **Very expensive** (cheapest useful one is 9,000 gp for Empower Lesser)
- Only **3 uses per day** for metamagic rods
- Competes with weapon slot (can't hold staff AND rod)

---

### Staffs - Flexible Spell Libraries (16,500 - 211,000 gp)

**What They Do:**
- Store **multiple related spells** (usually 4-6 different spells)
- Come with **50 charges** when created
- Spells cost **1-5 charges** depending on power
- **Use wielder's caster level and ability score** for save DCs!
- Can hold spells of **any level** (unlike wands limited to 4th)
- Standard action to activate (spell trigger, no AoO)
- Often function as **+2 quarterstaffs** as weapons
- **Recharge 1/day** (actually, no - staffs don't recharge, I misread)

**Actually, correction:** Staffs have 50 charges when created and **do NOT recharge**. Once empty, they become mundane quarterstaffs (or remain +2 quarterstaffs if they had that property).

**Pricing Examples:**
```
Staff of Charming (16,500 gp):
  - Charm Person (1 charge)
  - Charm Monster (2 charges)
  Total: 50 charges = 16-25 uses

Staff of Fire (28,500 gp):
  - Burning Hands (1 charge)
  - Fireball (1 charge)
  - Wall of Fire (2 charges)
  Total: 50 charges = 25-50 uses

Staff of Healing (27,750 gp):
  - Lesser Restoration (1 charge)
  - Cure Serious Wounds (1 charge)
  - Remove Blindness/Deafness (2 charges)
  - Remove Disease (3 charges)

Staff of Power (211,000 gp):
  - Magic Missile (1 charge)
  - Fireball/Lightning Bolt (1 charge)
  - Cone of Cold (2 charges)
  - Globe of Invulnerability (2 charges)
  - PLUS +2 quarterstaff, +2 luck to AC/saves
  - Can be broken for retributive strike!

School Staffs (65,000 gp each):
  - Evocation, Conjuration, Enchantment, etc.
  - 6 spells each from that school
  - 1-3 charges per spell
```

**Key Advantage:** Staffs use **YOUR** caster level and ability score! A 15th-level wizard using Staff of Fire casts Fireball at CL 15 (15d6 damage) with his own save DC (likely DC 19+), not the minimum CL 5.

**Best For:**
- **High-level casters** who have good DCs (makes spells potent)
- Backup spells you didn't prepare that day
- Broadening spell selection without preparing
- Themed spell packages (fire mage gets Staff of Fire)
- **MUCH better than wands for save-or-die spells**

**Weaknesses:**
- **Expensive** (cheapest is 16,500 gp)
- **Can't recharge** - once 50 charges are gone, it's done
- Takes up weapon/hand slot
- Still need to be a spellcaster to use them

At Level 13, focus on:
- **Maxed mental stat** (Headband +6)
- **Solid defenses** (Cloak, Ring, Amulet, Bracers)
- **ONE metamagic rod** (Empower Lesser is best value)
- **Wands for utility**
- **Scrolls for situational spells**

12. **Staff of Divination** - 73,500 gp (utility spells)

**Total with 2 cheaper staffs**: 386,000 gp

## Summary: Caster Equipment Strategy

### Early Levels (3-8): Wands Only
- **Focus**: Headband (mental stat), Cloak (saves), defensive wondrous items
- **Wands**: Cheap utility and backup (Mage Armor, Shield, CLW, Invisibility)
- **Why no staff**: Too expensive, you're not high enough level to make good use
- **Cost**: 750 - 11,250 gp per wand

### Mid Levels (10-13): First Staff OR Metamagic Rod
- **Priority**: Max out Big Six basics
- **Choice**: Either ONE cheaper staff (16,500 - 29,000 gp) OR metamagic rod (9,000 - 14,000 gp)
- **Staff option**: Staff of Fire, Charming, Healing (16,500 - 28,500 gp)
- **Rod option**: Rod of Empower Lesser (9,000 gp) for damage boost
- **Why**: Budget is tight, can't afford both yet

### High Levels (15-17): Staff + Rods
- **Now affordable**: School Staff (65,000 gp) + 1-2 lesser rods
- **Best combo**: Staff of Evocation + Rod of Empower (Normal) + Rod of Quicken (Lesser)
- **Total**: ~145,000 gp for staff + rods

### Epic Levels (20): Multiple Staffs + Multiple Rods
- **Dream loadout**: Staff of Power + utility staff + 3 metamagic rods
- **Cost**: ~584,000 gp for staff/rod collection
- **Remaining budget**: ~176,000 gp for wands, scrolls, potions, situational items

### Key Insights:
1. **Wands are for utility**, not combat (low save DCs)
2. **Staffs are for flexible casting** at YOUR power level
3. **Rods are for efficiency** (boost your prepared spells)
4. **Never buy a +1-+5 weapon for a wizard** - total waste of 2,000-50,000 gp!

### Budget Allocation for Casters:
- **60%**: Mental stat item + defensive wondrous items (Cloak, Ring, Amulet, Bracers)
- **25%**: Staffs and Rods
- **15%**: Wands, scrolls, potions, consumables
