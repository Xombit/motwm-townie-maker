## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

### 🚨 MAJOR ISSUE: Armor Enhancement Costs are WRONG!

**The enhancement recommendation costs use Scale Mail (50 gp base), but Town Guard gets Full Plate (1,500 gp base) at level 10!**

This means ALL armor enhancement costs from level 10+ are underestimated by ~1,450 gp:
- Scale Mail +3: 50 + 150 + 18,000 = 18,200 gp
- Full Plate +3: **1,500 + 150 + 18,000 = 19,650 gp** (1,450 gp MORE)

This affects every armor enhancement level 10-20!

   - ✅ +1 weapon (2,315 gp) affordable
   - ❌ +2 weapon (8,315 gp) too expensive (short by ~3,400-5,000 gp)
   - Only ONE option available at these critical early levels

3. **Level 7**: Budget 7,183 gp

   - ❌ +3 weapon (18,315 gp) too expensive (short by 8,092 gp)

   - ✅ +1 Keen (8,315 gp) affordable
   - ❌ +3 weapon (18,315 gp) BARELY too expensive at level 10 (short by 283 gp!) 🔴

### Armor Enhancement Problems:

1. **Level 3-4**: Budget 885-1,803 gp
   - +1 Scale Mail costs 1,200 gp (50 + 150 + 1,000)
   - ❌ **Level 3 can't afford ANY magic armor!** (short by 315 gp)

   - +1 Moderate Fort Full Plate: 1,500 + 150 + 32,000 = **33,650 gp** (vs 32,200 Scale Mail)
   - At level 10: Budget is 16,134 gp but +3 Full Plate costs 19,650 gp = **TOO EXPENSIVE** 🔴

5. **Level 11+**: Full Plate enhancement costs NOT IN SYSTEM
   - Level 11: Budget 21,914 gp
     - +3 Full Plate costs 19,650 gp ✅ (finally affordable!)
     - +2 Light Fort Full Plate costs 12,650 gp ✅
     - +1 Moderate Fort Full Plate costs 33,650 gp ❌ (too expensive until level 13)

---

## ⚡ RECOMMENDATIONS - PRIORITY ORDER

### 🚨 URGENT (System-Breaking Bugs):

1. **Fix Enhancement Cost Calculation** - CRITICAL!
   - Enhancement costs must be calculated from ACTUAL equipped armor, not assumed Scale Mail
   - At level 10+, Town Guard has Full Plate (1,500 gp) not Scale Mail (50 gp)
   - This is a ~1,450 gp difference PER enhancement!
   - Current system will select unaffordable enhancements

2. **Add Affordable Options for Levels 3-4** - Martials get first magic items here!
   - Level 3 weapon budget: 989 gp vs +1 cost 2,315 gp (1,326 gp short)
   - Level 4 weapon budget: 2,015 gp vs +1 cost 2,315 gp (299 gp short)
   - OPTIONS:
     a) Lower +1 weapon cost in recommendations (not realistic)
     b) **Increase weapon budget from 38% to 42-45%** at early levels ✅
     c) Give level 3-4 characters higher starting wealth (breaks DMG)
   - **RECOMMENDED**: Progressive budget allocation (more to weapon early, balanced later)

3. **Add Mid-Tier Options for Level 5-10** - Too many single-option levels
   - Level 5-7: Add +1 Flaming at ~6,500 gp (cheaper than current 8,315 gp)
   - Level 8-10: Add +2 Keen or +2 Flaming at ~15,000 gp
   - Level 8-10: Add +3 basic enhancement option (currently missing from bracket!)

### 🔥 HIGH PRIORITY (Progression Gaps):

4. **Fix Level 11-13 Bracket** - First option too expensive
   - All 5 options cost 32,315 gp
   - Level 11 budget: 24,492 gp (7,823 gp short!)
   - Level 12 budget: 33,440 gp (finally affordable)
   - **Add options at 24,000-28,000 gp range**:
     - +3 Keen (~24,000 gp)
     - +3 Flaming (~24,000 gp)  
     - +2 Keen + Shocking (~24,000 gp)

5. **Rebalance Budget Allocation for Early Levels**
   - Levels 3-7: Weapon 42%, Armor 32% (prioritize offense early)
   - Levels 8-13: Weapon 40%, Armor 34% (balanced)
   - Levels 14-20: Weapon 38%, Armor 34% (current system fine)
   - Fighters NEED their weapon to be effective!

### 🛠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY (Quality of Life):

6. **Full Plate Timing Adjustment**
   - Current: Gets Full Plate at level 10
   - Problem: Can't afford to enchant it properly (budget too tight)
   - OPTIONS:
     a) Delay Full Plate to level 11-12 (when budget can handle enhanced Full Plate)
     b) **Keep Scale Mail through level 11, allow higher enchantments** ✅
     c) Give Full Plate earlier (level 8-9) so it's established before expensive enhancements
   - **RECOMMENDED**: Keep Scale Mail through level 11, switch to Full Plate at 12+

7. **Add More Enhancement Variety**
   - Mid-tier options missing (12k-17k range)
   - More special ability combinations
   - Alternative paths (cold/electric instead of just fire)

8. **Document Budget Philosophy**
   - Early levels: Weapon-focused (42% weapon, 32% armor)
   - Mid levels: Balanced (40% weapon, 34% armor)
   - High levels: Optimized (38% weapon, 34% armor)
   - Why: Martials rely on weapon for offense, armor scales slower
