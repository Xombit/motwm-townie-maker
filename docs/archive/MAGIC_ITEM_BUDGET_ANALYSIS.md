## Implementation Strategy

### Priority Algorithm

For each character, purchase in this order:

1. **Weapon Enhancement** (if martial character)
2. **Armor Enhancement** (if wears armor) / **Bracers of Armor** (if doesn't)
3. **Primary Stat Boost** (class-appropriate)
4. **Cloak of Resistance** (universal)
5. **Defensive Item** (Amulet of Natural Armor or Ring of Protection)
6. **Secondary Stat Boost** (if budget allows)
7. **Class-Specific Items** (Pearls, Wands, special items)
8. **Utility Items** (skill boosters, movement, etc.)
9. **Consumables** (potions, scrolls) with remaining budget

### Scaling by Tier

- **Tier 1 (1-5):** Basic +1/+2 bonuses
- **Tier 2 (6-10):** Enhanced +2/+3 bonuses, +4 stats
- **Tier 3 (11-15):** Superior +3/+4 bonuses, +6 stats, special abilities
- **Tier 4 (16-20):** Epic +5 bonuses, multiple +6 stats, exotic items

### Reserved Budget

Always reserve 10-20% of budget for:
- Healing potions (essential for survival)
- Utility consumables (scrolls, wands)
- Situational items

## Next Steps

1. Define 4 magic item tiers with specific level ranges
2. Create tier-appropriate item lists for each class archetype
3. Implement magic item selection algorithm
4. Add special case handling (casters get wands/pearls, rogues get skill items, etc.)
5. Test at key levels (1, 5, 10, 15, 20) to verify budget adherence
