## Recommendations for Townie-Maker Implementation

### Priority 1: Implement These SRD Items (Well-Covered Categories)

**Storage (Essential)**
- Handy Haversack (2,000 GP) - MUST HAVE for all characters
- Bag of Holding I (2,500 GP) - Basic storage
- Bag of Holding IV (10,000 GP) - Heavy haulers
- Portable Hole (20,000 GP) - High-level characters

**Flight (Good Coverage)**
- Broom of Flying (17,000 GP) - Mid-level option
- Carpet of Flying 5x5 (20,000 GP) - Mid-level comfort
- Wings of Flying (54,000 GP) - High-level permaflight

**Miss Chances (Decent Coverage)**
- Eversmoking Bottle (5,400 GP) - Budget option (creates fog)
- Minor Cloak of Displacement (24,000 GP) - Standard choice, 20% miss
- Ring of Blinking (27,000 GP) - Complex but powerful

**Freedom of Movement (Excellent Single Option)**
- Ring of Freedom of Movement (40,000 GP) - High-level essential

**Dispel Protection (Basic Coverage)**
- Ring of Counterspells (4,000 GP) - One-shot protection

**True Seeing (Expensive but Available)**
- Gem of Seeing (75,000 GP) - Very high level only

### Priority 2: Categories with No SRD Solution

For these, either:
1. **Skip entirely** (rely on class features/spells)
2. **Create custom items** using DMG guidelines
3. **Note in documentation** that these require DM/campaign-specific solutions

**Categories to Skip/Note:**
- Stun Negation (no SRD items)
- Daze Negation (no SRD items)
- Special Senses (no SRD items)
- Initiative boosts (no good SRD items)
- Tactical Teleportation (SRD items not recommended)
- Death Effects/Energy Drain (limited options)

### Priority 3: Consider Creating "Townie-Maker Variants"

Since the guide identifies many non-SRD items as superior (cheaper, better mechanics), consider:

**Option A: SRD-Only Mode (Current Plan)**
- Use only DMG/PHB items listed above
- Accept gaps in coverage
- Document missing capabilities

**Option B: "Essential Items" Custom Pricing**
- Create simplified versions of key non-SRD items
- Base on DMG custom item guidelines
- Examples:
  - "Amulet of Short Teleport" (based on Anklet of Translocation concept)
  - "Headband of Quick Reactions" (initiative bonus, based on pricing guidelines)
  - "Talisman of Fortitude" (stun negation, based on similar effects)

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core SRD Items (Immediate Implementation)

Implement these well-covered categories first:

1. **Storage** (Level 3+)
   - Handy Haversack at 2000 GP (priority item for all)
   - Bags of Holding as wealth increases

2. **Weapon/Armor Enhancements** (Already in SRD, from previous analysis)
   - +1 to +5 weapons/armor
   - Special abilities

### Phase 2: Mid-Level SRD Items (Level 6-10)

3. **Miss Chances** (Level 8+)
   - Eversmoking Bottle (5400 GP) - creative use
   - Minor Cloak of Displacement (24000 GP) - level 9+

4. **Flight** (Level 9+)
   - Broom of Flying (17000 GP)
   - Carpet of Flying (20000 GP)

5. **Dispel Protection** (Level 5+)
   - Ring of Counterspells (4000 GP)

### Phase 3: High-Level SRD Items (Level 11+)

6. **Freedom of Movement** (Level 11+)
   - Ring of Freedom of Movement (40000 GP)

7. **Flight Upgrade** (Level 13+)
   - Wings of Flying (54000 GP)

8. **True Seeing** (Level 15+)
   - Gem of Seeing (75000 GP)

9. **Mind Blank** (Level 18+, if using psionics)
   - Third Eye Conceal (120000 GP)

### Phase 4: Document Gaps

Create documentation noting:
- Categories without SRD solutions
- Recommended house rules or alternatives
- Suggested spells/class features as substitutes

---

## "Big Six" Analysis

The D&D 3.5 community often refers to the "Big Six" essential items:

1. **Weapon enhancement** - ✅ SRD (good coverage)
2. **Armor enhancement** - ✅ SRD (good coverage)
3. **Cloak of Resistance** - ✅ SRD (already in our budget analysis)
4. **Ring of Protection** - ✅ SRD (already in our budget analysis)
5. **Amulet of Natural Armor** - ✅ SRD (already in our budget analysis)
6. **Stat-boosting items** (Headband, Belt, etc.) - ✅ SRD (already in our budget analysis)

**Big Six Coverage: EXCELLENT** - All in SRD, already analyzed in MAGIC_ITEM_BUDGET_ANALYSIS.md

---

## Conclusion

**SRD Coverage Summary:**
- **Strong**: Storage, Big Six stat/AC/saves items, basic flight, basic miss chances
- **Moderate**: True Seeing (expensive), Mind Blank (psionics), Freedom of Movement (one expensive option)
- **Weak/Missing**: Initiative, Tactical Teleportation, Death Effects, Special Senses, Stun/Daze negation

**Recommendation**: Implement Phase 1-3 items listed above. These cover the most essential capabilities with SRD-only items. Accept that some forum guide "nice to haves" (like cheap teleportation and initiative boosts) won't be available in SRD-only mode.

**For Townie-Maker**: Focus on Big Six + Handy Haversack as core. Add flight, miss chances, and FoM as wealth allows. Document gaps for DM customization.
